# FeedReaderTesting
# Project Scenario Overview Given By Udacity

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

**The Scenario:** The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, already including [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/), and had even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where I come in.
